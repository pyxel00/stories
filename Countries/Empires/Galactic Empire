Galactic Empire consists of seven parts : 
- Empire : Whole of the empire.

- Planet : A planet consists of three main parts. The crust which is the outer ring that consists of mostly rocks and is cool enough for life to develop, 
a mantle which is a semi-solid part that is inbetween the core and the crust, and finally the core which is the biggest part of a planet that mostly consists of iron and
nickel and is the main source of heat and magnetic field.
- Moon : A smaller planet that orbits a bigger planet.
- Settlement : Small houses and job stations that are on the planet or orbiting the planet.
- Squad : Small teams that consist of five to six people. These are the smallest parts of the empire that make the dirty jobs.
