"Once they were the most powerful of the universe. Now they are just a myth. Yet their influence still exists..."

According to a myth from the elders of the universe there existed an empire. An empire so powerful their influence effected the whole galaxy and possibly
others. So powerful that even though they were eradicated their influence is still in its place.

This empire is known as the Xenuxian Empire but its original name is unknown.

Xenuxian Empire was once the most powerful empire in the galaxy and possibly others until it was dissolved by the Galaxy Coalition.

Most of the Xenuxian technology is lost to history but some are still around. These designs were so powerful they modernized the whole galaxy.
But these technologies will be discussed in another file.

According to the myth Xenuxian Empire had a very elaborate political system.
Empire was divided into 4 fiefdoms. Each controlled by a high ranking official.
These fiefdoms were known as
- Fiefdom of Progress
- Fiefdom of Truth
- Fiefdom of Law
- Fiefdom of Security

Controllers of these 4 fiefdoms were the following.
- Fiefdom of Progress : Xeon Glith
- Fiefdom of Truth    : Pron Zicks
- Fiefdom of Law      : Nix Glith
- Fiefdom of Security : Leon Moey

- Xeon Glith : Army general, physicist, chemist, biologist and smartest Xenuxian known.
- Pron Zicks : Head of the department of Investigation.
- Nix Glith  : Head of the department of Law. Sister of Xeon Glith.
- Leon Moey  : Head of internal security.

It is impossible to know truth but these are the best we can get.
