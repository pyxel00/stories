Superluminal drive is a part for spaceships that were created by the xenuxians. It works by bendind the spacetime so much so that it almost breaks.
Almost being the key word. It is unknown how this drive is able to bend spacetime this much. But it is thought the antimatter used inside of it has 
something to do with this power. Blueprint of the superluminal drive and the first examples of it were found in the star system HD200103. It was
first found by an archeologist who lived in the star system. Blueprint was in xenuxian. An ancient language spoken by xenuxian's long time ago.
Since there is no knowledge of the language or a xenuxian translator the blueprint was never understood fully. Blueprint was understood by the pictograms
used to describe how to built a superluminal drive. Information of how it works is still in that blueprint but it is impossible to read. Unless someone
who knows xenuxian language comes along. Somehow.
