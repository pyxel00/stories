Xenuxians were the one of the oldest species in the galaxy. They were almost the same as the humans from the outside. But from the inside they were 
completely different.

So little of a xenuxian's inner systems are known as they went extinct a long time ago.

- The first difference and perhaps the most strange one is a new base in the xenuxian DNA called Zyrox. This new base allowed xenuxians to have a lot
complexity than any other organism in the galaxy. Not much is known about this new base. But one thing is certain. This base allowed xenuxians to have
unordinary skills.

- The difference that would be noticed the most is the increased power in a xenuxian's muscle. Xenuxian muscles are much more efficient and powerful than
a humans muscle. This allows them to grip longer than any human could and punch through things that would seem impossible.

- Xenuxian minds are extraordinarily wired. They are able to understand concepts that are deemed almost impossible to comprehend even by an artificial 
intelligence. With this extraordinary power they are able to manipulate and understand the universe as they wish. Strange part is every xenuxian has a 
special wiring for their brain. Some of them can understand physics very well. Some are really good with memory. Some create art pieces that are very
hard to comprehend. List goes on.

- Another difference that xenuxians have is unusual ability to observe. Xenuxians can derive someone's mental state, physical state and habits and other
stuff by just looking at them for ten seconds. There are times where they are wrong. But most of the they are accurate.
