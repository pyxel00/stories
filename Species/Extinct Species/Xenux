Xenuxians were the one of the oldest species in the galaxy. They were almost the same as the humans from the outside. But from the inside they were 
completely different.

So little of a xenuxian's inner systems are known as they went extinct a long time ago.

- The first difference and perhaps the most strange one is a new base in the xenuxian DNA called Zyrox. This new base allowed xenuxians to have a lot
complexity than any other organism in the galaxy. Not much is known about this new base. But one thing is certain. This base allowed xenuxians to have
unordinary skills.

- The difference that would be noticed the most is the increased power in a xenuxians muscle. Xenuxian muscles are much more efficient and powerful than a
humans muscle. This allows them to grip longer than any human could and punch through things that would seem impossible.
