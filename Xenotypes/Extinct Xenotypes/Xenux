Xenux is one of the oldest naturally occuring human xenotype that evolved in a distant star system. It is unknown how much of their DNA is similiar to a
human DNA but it is estimated to be around 96%.

There is some key differences that make xenuxians very powerful and superior to humans. These are as following:
- Higher brain power.
- Powerful muscles.
- Unusual ability of observation.

I) Higher Brain Power :
   First and the most noticible key difference is the higher brain power of xenuxians. It is known that xenuxians were the most intelligent species/xeno-
type in the galaxy. They are able to do complicated calculations in seconds inside their head. Because of this intelligent difference they were also very
ahead of every known species in the galaxy.

II) Powerful Muscles :
    Xenuxians have unusual power in their muscles. They are able to punch through 20 centimeters(~7.8 inches) of solid steel with only their punch.
Their bones are still, as fragile as a human bone.

III) Unusual Ability of Observation :
    Xenuxians have an unusual ability to observe things. They can derive future interactions that will happen in 5-6 hours ahead of time. This ability 
introduces itself both in the physical world and in minds. They are able to derive what is someone thinking or will do in 5-6 hours with 85% accuracy.

Not all differences are known since the Xenuxians were eradicated by other species.

But there is a legend among the elders of the galaxy. According to the legend some xenuxians, estimated to be around 10, flew of to a distant star system
and hide. It is unknown if it is true. But if it is there is no doubt that xenuxians want revenge. And if they get enough time(around 6-7 years) it is 
undoubtable that they will come back with a very, VERY, powerful weapon.
