"They were the master minds of technology... They had a brain wired just for it..."

One of the oldest and the best technology in the universe were made by the xenuxians. Most of the technology is gone but few remain. Either in current 
ships or in xenuxian wrecks.

Some of these technology are as following:

-Superluminal Drive : A special technology that bends the physics of the universe so much that it almost breaks. Almost being the key word. Xenuxian tech-
nology created one of the most sophisticated travel methods known in the universe. It was so complicated and strange that no one could understand it. 
But one day, an archeologist found a blueprint that was left in the solar system of HD22190 where the archeologist lived. Blueprint explained how to make
a Superluminal Drive. Exact procedure for how to make a xenuxian technology was found. And transportation was revolutionised. Still no one knows how it 
works but lucky for everyone the xenuxian that invented the first Superluminal Drive used pictograms to explain everything.
